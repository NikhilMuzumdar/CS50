<!-- Early Life -->
<br>
<h2><span class="badge bg-secondary">Early life</span></h2>
<div class="d-flex p-2 bd-highlight">
    Ham was born in July 1957 in French Cameroon (now Cameroon), captured by animal trappers and sent to the Rare Bird
    Farm in Miami, Florida. He was purchased by the United States Air Force and brought to Holloman Air Force Base in
    July 1959. There were originally 40 chimpanzee flight candidates at Holloman. After evaluation, the number of
    candidates was reduced to 18, then to six, including Ham. Officially, Ham was known as No. 65 before his flight,[8]
    and only renamed "Ham" upon his successful return to Earth. This was reportedly because officials did not want the
    bad press that would come from the death of a "named" chimpanzee if the mission were a failure.[9] Among his
    handlers, No. 65 had been known as "Chop Chop Chang".

<!-- Training and mission -->
<br>
<h2><span class="badge bg-secondary">Training and mission</span></h2>
<div class="d-flex p-2 bd-highlight">
    Beginning in July 1959, the two-year-old chimpanzee was trained under the direction of neuroscientist Joseph V.
    Brady at Holloman Air Force Base Aero-Medical Field Laboratory to do simple, timed tasks in response to electric
    lights and sounds. During his pre-flight training, Ham was taught to push a lever within five seconds of seeing a
    flashing blue light; failure to do so resulted in an application of a light electric shock to the soles of his feet,
    while a correct response earned him a banana pellet.<br>On January 31, 1961, Ham was secured in a Project Mercury
    mission designated MR-2 and launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a suborbital flight.314–315  Ham's vital signs
    and tasks were monitored by sensors and computers on Earth. The capsule suffered a partial loss of pressure during
    the flight, but Ham's space suit prevented him from suffering any harm.: 315  Ham's lever-pushing performance in
    space was only a fraction of a second slower than on Earth, demonstrating that tasks could be performed in
    space.: 316  Ham's capsule splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean and was recovered by the USS Donner later that
    day.: 316  His only physical injury was a bruised nose. His flight was 16 minutes and 39 seconds long.<br>The
    results from his test flight led directly to the mission Alan Shepard made on May 5, 1961, aboard Freedom 7.

<h2><span class="badge bg-secondary">Later Life</span></h2>
<div class="d-flex p-2 bd-highlight">
    On April 5, 1963, Ham was transferred to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. where he lived for 17 years  before
    joining a small group of chimps at North Carolina Zoo on September 25, 1980. After his death on January 19, 1983,
    Ham's body was given to the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology for necropsy. Following the necropsy, the plan was
    to have him stuffed and placed on display at the Smithsonian Institution, following Soviet precedent with pioneering
    space dogs Belka, and Strelka.<br>However, this plan was abandoned after a negative public reaction. Ham's skeleton
    is held in the collection of the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Silver Spring, Maryland,[6] and the rest of
    Ham's remains were buried at the International Space Hall of Fame in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Colonel John Stapp gave
    the eulogy at the memorial service.<br>Ham's backup, Minnie, was the only female chimpanzee trained for the Mercury
    program. After her role in the Mercury program ended, Minnie became part of an Air Force chimpanzee breeding
    program, producing nine offspring and helping to raise the offspring of several other members of the chimpanzee
    colony.  She was the last surviving Astro-chimpanzee and died at age 41 on March 14, 1998.
